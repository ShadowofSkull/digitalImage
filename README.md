# Digital Image Processing (Final Project)

## QuickStart
1. Make sure numpy and opencv is installed
```shell
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
2. Run the `main.py` file to process videos
```shell
python main.py
```
3. In the terminal it will ask for user input for the video filename to process (extensions are not needed, e.g. .mp4) (sample: office)
4. After processing the new video will be in the `out` folder with same name with `_processed_vid` append to the name
